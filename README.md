# CVPR 2017 notes (on-going)
This is my personal notes and focuses on several aspects:  
1. Feature detection and matching  
2. Geometry computer vision (and deep learning)   
3. Object detection and recognition  
4. Object tracking   
5. Face processing  
6. Computation photography 
7. SLAM 
8. Real-time application of computer vision
